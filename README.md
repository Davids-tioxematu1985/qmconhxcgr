Just walked out of Wolf Man and my head's still spinning like I've been working on a tangled mess of wires all day. The theater was one of those loud ones, echoing sounds off the walls like a toolbox falling off a shelf. Popcorn crumbs everywhere, like confetti but, you know, not festive. My back's killing me — those seats are built like punishment devices.

Man, his transformation—wild. Like, if my electrical panel blew a fuse while I was rewiring and just—POW—fur everywhere. Eerie growls, and the whole theater just goes quiet, holding our breath, like waiting for the circuit breaker to kick back in.

> That scene, you know the one, with the full moon almost looking like a spotlight on his face, reminded me of the time I was stuck in a crawlspace and the only light was my flickering headlamp. My mind wanders back to repairing that one crazy, crowded electrical box; kind of how his mind must've felt, chaotic and ready to burst with energy.

He runs through the forest and it vibes almost like the tangled mess of cables behind an unlabeled panel—mystery in every turn. Somehow, I remembered I need to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   later for old man Joe. He wanted to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   but can't make it out.

The actress—uh, name's lost on me now—gave one of those screams that feels like jamming a screwdriver into a live outlet, sharp and full of regret.

Where do the lights lead? I mean, I'm just buzzing here. Maybe it was the soda, maybe just the thrill of it. That howl. Holy hell, like a dog gone feral after chewing through some rotten wiring.

One of those flicks you think you might never truly understand, like those times I forget which breaker I flipped and end up toggling them all like some hopeful fool. Definitely not the last thing on my list, but I gotta admit, it's got me hooked like a stubborn extension cord that just won't come apart. I’ll tell Paul to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  ; he’s got a thing for hairy monsters and bad CGI.

Random thought: Moon hanging high, like a burnt-out halogen bulb glowing its last. Why did I eat so much popcorn? Its kernels are like little reminders of questionable choices.

Oops, sorry, just walked ten paces into the wrong street. Can't think straight, not that the   helped much in that department. But boy, was it worth it...
